<h1>The Old Way</h1>
<p>
    Not so long ago, coding was about 5% productivity and 95% debugging code.
    Being a good engineer was predicated on the ability to quickly resolve bugs, rather than the ability to create new ideas and bring them to life.
    I remember it like it was yesterday. My old colleague, Alex Pouzikov, stayed on a Google Meet with me after a standup meeting and told me I had to check out ChatGPT.

<h1>The Turning of a Page</h1>
<p>
    Alex was a bright kid with a lot of complicated ideas that, I'll admit, were sometimes lost on me.
    It took me about a week before I finally took a look, and another few months before I unlocked its power.
    The kind of work that would usually take me a full day now only takes some articulation to the OpenAI interface.
    I'll never have to search for a typo again.
</p>
<p>
    It was a good few months that we all enjoyed of expectations at work being consistent with the old way while productivity skyrocketed.
    I am not sure if management caught onto our new tool or if their expectations of our productivity have just shifted to our new normal.
    Developers can now be so much more productive and hence speed up the development of the products that we are working on by many multiples.

<h1>What It Means for Developers</h1>
<p>
    Now as I work on building a portfolio of my work, I can display what I do in my day job.
    However, the details of styling the website and determining the right components to use are no more my concern than the degree to which I decide to take ownership of their customization.
    Also, the projects that I am putting out are a conglomeration of many features, instead of just one or two features that I painstakingly produced by hand by myself.
    In short, my ability as a developer to bring ideas to life and to pull features together into products has become the focus of my development journey.
</p>
<p>
    I think that this is closer to the real reason that we develop software. 
    The reason is not to show that we are good at writing and understanding code, although that is important.
    The ability to understand the code being written is as important as ever.
    The reason engineers are hired and the reason that I love what I do is for my ability to bring my ideas to life.
    I am excited about this newfound burst of creativity and what it means for the tech world's output in the future.

<h1>A Quick Anecdote</h1>
<p>
    I remember having a conversation with a high-ranking engineering manager in my company about ChatGPT.
    He was worried that these kinds of tools would limit engineers' abilities to learn and grow from trial and error.
    I have often heard math teachers make the same argument about using a calculator.
    There is something to be said for understanding how to do things and why to do them in a certain way.
    In my view, the importance of that skill is not lost. 
    However, one's ability to combine that skill with modern practices for the development of technology is the future of how we will move forward in this field.
