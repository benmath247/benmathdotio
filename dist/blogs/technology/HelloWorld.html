    Today was really cool. 
    For a while, I have felt pretty lucky about my career. 
    Not only do I get to be a software engineer and work remotely full-time at an American company while traveling the world,
    but I also get to do it in an age where AI is augmenting developer productivity at an unprecedented rate.
</p>
<h4>A little background</h4>
<p>
    I have made portfolio sites for myself before, but nothing stuck because of technical issues that I have learned from.
    Admittedly, I don't like design. 
    I can barely dress myself for a date, let alone pick out colors for a website.
    But with ChatGPT and Bootstrap, as well as a bunch of ideas in my head from past projects, I can (more or less) get the job done in just an afternoon.
</p>
<p>
    So here I am again, posting a Hello World blog post on what I think may be the third rendition of a personal/portfolio site.
    What's different about this one is meaningful to me.
</p>
<p>I have really been upgrading my front-end skills. I was originally a back-end developer with experience first in Java, then Python (Django).
    About a year ago, I was told that I was going to work on front-end projects. I didn't like the idea of a front-end-based blog because I didn't really have any ideas on how it might work.
    It seemed like the code would be disorganized and difficult to attain both consistency and the customizability that HTML has to offer.
</p>
<p>
    My last project used what I was comfortable with, Django. I made a Django back end with an API that I could call to get all of my blog posts.
    Organizing them into categories with tags and such was very possible but also cumbersome and not really what I wanted to spend my time doing.
    When it came to deployment, I didn't want to have an EC2 instance constantly running, so I implemented a little trick I created at work for our production environments and copied all of the blog API calls to a JSON file that the site could read instead of making a back-end call.
    That was cool but it was difficult to edit if I was truly going to keep all of the code in the back end and not edit HTML in a JSON file.
</p>
<h3>The answer</h3>
<p>
    What I thought of today was quite simple, but it was the answer to a complicated question. As I write this blog post, I am using an HTML file.
    This is cool for a couple of reasons. 
<ol>
    <li>I can use my IDE to make sure I am not messing up writing HTML.</li>
    <li>I don't have to rely on a back end to serve up or organize my blog posts for me. I also don't need to maintain it.</li>
    <li>The best part: I can do all kinds of things with style that I couldn't do before!</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    My last solutions had some customization options which were nice but didn't really get the job done.
    I had a Django plugin called CKEditor which allowed me to use a WYSIWYG editor to produce HTML.
    It could take care of things like hyperlinks and color but it was pretty limited. 
</p>
<p>My blog posts were limited to text and could not use any third-party style libraries, like Bootstrap!
    This solution just helps my site look a lot better. I have no need for Bootstrap in this blog post, but it will be cool to use carousels, forms, and other awesome stuff in future blog posts and have a more dynamic experience for my user.
</p>
<p>
    Another great advantage to this is that I can use ChatGPT to help me make awesome blog designs. 
    It is pretty obvious when ChatGPT has written a blog post, and I think that it takes a lot of it for a reader.
    But for coding, it is really valuable. Learning every in and out of Bootstrap and other front-end libraries is not what I want to do with my career.
    However, I do want my sites to look extra awesome. With ChatGPT, all I need to know is generally what components are available and AI will do the rest in helping me customize.
</p>
<p>
    This process helped me get up and running in just an afternoon, instead of taking me weeks like it would have earlier in my career.
    Now I can focus on content and providing value to my site visitors instead of working on endlessly debugging React files. 
    It also just helped me proofread this file and check it for typos. Yay!
