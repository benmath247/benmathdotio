    I never thought I'd be in Argentina. 
    I remember going to Spanish class in 8th grade and learning all of the Spanish speaking countries' names in a song.
    I think there was a test to get us to point to them on a map that week. If there was, I am pretty sure I did poorly.
    I have always believed that experience is the best teacher. Now I can point to all 50 states on a map and quite a few Latin American countries thanks to my travels.

    My wanderlust isn't exactly what brought me to Argentina though. While it was a contributing factor, the reason I am here is because of my wonderful girlfriend.
    She is from Argentina and was raised here until she was 7. She is kind of like me in that she fits into a lot of different environments well but doesn't fit into any specific one perfectly.
    Her English is 99.99% perfect, as is her Spanish. It is interesting to learn about her relationship with her Argentinian family and heritage while I am here. I feel really lucky to be able to do this trip with her, because I love traveling with her and because she is a local to the country.

    It has also been very special to get to know her family. It is a much bigger family than mine. 
    Her grandparents and aunt do not speak English well and I don't speak Spanish well either. Fortunately, language is only part of communication.
    We are doing just fine on my limited Spanish vocabulary and above average communication skills. Smiles and nonverbal communication have been great for making me feel right at home here.

    It is also interesting to see how similar her family is to mine, even though they are Argentinian. We are both from Jewish families and have very similar cuisines and traditions. I also feel right at home, like I am talking to old friends, when I speak with anyone in the family.
    There is a really special sense of familiarity that I appreciate in a place so far away from home.

    This trip is almost the last of a long series of trips that I have taken on my way out of NYC. When I get back to Philly I intend to hunker down and improve myself in my career, education, and physical condition for a while.
    Before I do that I had some unfinished business with my states travel. I went on a trip across the country to California, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho then back to Philly. I drove the whole way, with the exception of Jennifer who drove about 16 hours of the drive.
    The adventures that we had along the way are too many and too awesome to explain in this blog post. Next, I went to Medellin and now I am here in Buenos Aires. It has been a long time on the road, a total of four months. I left NYC at the end of August for my road trip. 
    I love this way of life but I am really looking forward to getting back and building my life with Jennifer in Philly.

    If I remember, I'll update this blog post later with some pics of my favorite travel adventures, that's all for now though! Only 10 more days on the road until I get to go back to the city I call home.
