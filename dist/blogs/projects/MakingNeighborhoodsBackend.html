<p>An unusual hobby of mine is affecting positive change in Philadelphia.
    I love picking up trash, shoveling snow, removing graffiti, mentoring youth, and however else I can help.
    Doing this on my free time brings me a lot of happiness.</p>
<p>
    It is weird for two reasons. First, my hobby is limited to Philadelphia. I never did or wanted to do anything like
    this in NYC.
    I think that may be because Philly really needs it and Philly is my home. I was raised around here and I take a lot
    of pride in my city.
    It is also weird because I think the people tasked with taking care of our city at the highest levels like record
    keeping, the streets department, sanitation, and other governing entities do not take the job as seriously as I do.
    Public sector work in Philly has a lot of good actors but a lot more people who do as little as possible.
</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>
    Having just moved to Philly, I want to help at the neighborhood level. It is cold out so cleaning and starting new
    projects isn't an option right now.
    But I did notice that a lot of the neighborhood associations in Philly have websites built with Wix, Squarespace, or
    Wordpress. What a drag!
    I am here to help. Now that I have worked in React for some time I can spin up front ends quickly.
    However, the neighborhoods will only work with me if I give them a frontend that they can edit with a backend.
    They all have 1-2 blog style data models, sometimes with categories, and meeting minutes.
    I am going to use Django admin to give them a backend that they can use to update these objects.
    It will have some interesting permission stuff that I will need to implement so that the neighborhood associations
    aren't touching each other's stuff.
</p>
<p>
    Let's get into it.
</p>
<h2>Django Setup</h2>
First I will set up the project with Django and install Django Rest Framework.
<pre>
    <code>
        pip install django
        django-admin startproject neighborhoods_backend
        cd neighborhoods_backend
        python manage.py migrate
        python3 manage.py runserver
    </code>
</pre>
<p>Yay!</p>
<img src="neighborhoods/djangostart.png" />
<h2>Creating a superuser</h2>
<p>I am not going to be making any frontend templates so most of this is going to rely on Django Admin and DRF for API
    calls.
    Time to make a superuser to login with.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        (venv) MacBook-Pro-10:neighborhoods_backend Ben$ python3 manage.py create
        superuser
        Username (leave blank to use 'ben'): ben
        Email address: ben@benmath.io
        Password: 
        Password (again): 
        Superuser created successfully.
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Next I go to my localhost:8000/admin and login</p>
<img src="neighborhoods/adminstart.png" />
<p>Here is my starting application.</p>
<p>I have been trying to work off of lists more, so here is a list of things for me to do to complete the application
    from this point.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make Django models for neighborhoods, users, blogtype1, blogtype2, categories, and minutes.</li>
    <li>Create DRF endpoints to access blogtype1, blogtype2, categories, and minutes according to neighborhood</li>
    <li>Configure permissions for each of these models in admin regarding association with the neighborhood associated
        with the logged in user. Users should not be able to edit other neighborhood objects</li>
    <li>Customize the Django Admin</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Let's start there.
</p>
<h2>1. Make Django models for neighborhoods, users, blogtype1, blogtype2, categories, and minutes.</h2>
Before I do anything, I'll need to make an App and hook it into my project settings file.

The first step is to go into models.py and start to make things happen.
<pre>
    <code>
        (venv) MacBook-Pro-10:neighborhoods_backend Ben$ python manage.py startapp neighborhoods_api
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Next, I'll add it to my settings.py file of my neighborhoods_backend project.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'neighborhoods_api'
]
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Now I will add the models I came up with to models.py.
    See the comments for explanations of what is going on.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
# models.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group

# Neighborhood associations all have board minutes that they often upload as a file.
# They could also make it just text/HTML
class BoardMinutes(models.Model):
    neighborhood = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateField()
    content = models.TextField()
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='board_minutes/', null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.neighborhood.name+"-"+str(self.date)
    
# Blogs 1 and 2 will each have categories. Each neighborhood has their own set of categories
class Blog1Category(models.Model):
    neighborhood = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


class Blog2Category(models.Model):
    neighborhood = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

# Every neighborhood can have their own 2 sets of blogs
class Blog1(models.Model):
    neighborhood = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Blog1Category, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Blog2(models.Model):
    neighborhood = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Blog2Category, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    To save some time, I'll let my colleague ChatGPT give us a hand with serializers, views, and urlpatterns. It's a lot
    of code to share, so you can see the commit on <a
        href="https://github.com/benmath247/neighborhoods-backend/commit/99cbb4966f5ae069adb0bd8c92a21c557d6808cb">Github</a>
</p>
<p>One thing that I don't do every day that I got to do today is mess with the querysets and the way models are saved. I
    wanted to make sure that users can only view objects associated with their group. I also wanted to make sure that
    when they create an object, it is assigned to their neighborhood and not someone else's.</p>
<p>To do that, I overwrode get_queryset in Django Rest Framework's Generics list view.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
# admin.py
def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
    # Automatically set the neighborhood based on the user's group
    obj.neighborhood = request.user.groups.first()
    super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)

def get_queryset(self, request):
    # Filter objects based on the user's neighborhood
    queryset = super().get_queryset(request)
    if not request.user.is_superuser:
        queryset = queryset.filter(neighborhood=request.user.groups.first())
    return queryset
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    I also overwrote the Django Admin colors to make them resemble the Philadelphia Eagles and 76ers colors.
    Hopefully that draws some interest from the clients.
    It's a little trick I learned at work to help look a little more custom.
    You just add a templates/folder/base_site.html file in your project directoy.
    Copy over the code that defines the usual base_site.html from <a
        href="https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin">Django's Github</a> and
    edit according to your needs.
    I added a style sheet to override the old colors. You can also edit from any other file in that folder that defines
    the appearance of the admin.
</p>
<p>Well, that's all for my to do list! I am going to hook up Django CKEditor so the neighborhoods can edit their blogs
    as formatted text that turns into HTML.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
pip install django-ckeditor

# settings.py
import os

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'ckeditor',
    # ...
]

STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static_root')


DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'

CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
    'default': {
        'toolbar': 'full',
        'height': 300,
        'width': 600,
    },
}

    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    It's all in the <a
        href="https://github.com/benmath247/neighborhoods-backend/commit/320517f588805053ac9743ecc198bdd96e091463">commit
