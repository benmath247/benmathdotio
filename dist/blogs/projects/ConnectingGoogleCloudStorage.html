<h1>Good news!</h1>
<p>I have some great news. For reasons that are now behind me, I always saw connecting cloud storage as a difficult
    obstacle to overcome when deploying Django applications.
    Well, that is no longer. It is actually very simple with just a few code tweaks and some clicking around the Google
    Cloud console. You need a Google Cloud account, a project, and an access key. Creating that is outside of the scope
    of this blog
    post.
</p>
<h3>Creating the Bucket</h3>
<p>
    Next, go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a> and click Create a Bucket.
    For those who are super new at this, a bucket is where your files get held. You can think of it as a literal bucket
    of files.
</p>
<p>You can click through all of the default settings but ake sure to have "Enforce public access prevention on this
    bucket" unchecked as shown:
    <img src="./blogs/neighborhoods/gcsscreenshot1.png" />
    You need it unchecked because you are using this to host files that will be accessed by people on the web. Unless,
    you're not. Then leave it checked.
</p>
<p>
    Once your bucket is created, go to permissions and add the role or IAM condition associated with the key your
    project is going to use.
</p>
<p>
    If you have all of thie properly configured, the rest is easy. Add the following to your settings.py file to ensure
    your Django app is showing GCS its identification and authorization and pointing at the right place.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
# settings.py
import os
from google.cloud import storage

# Set the Google Cloud Storage credentials file path. 
# This is the path assuming you are starting in the folder that has manage.py in it.
# change this to wherever you put your file that we generated
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = './path/to/your/key.json'

# Create a storage client for use in views.py
storage_client = storage.Client()

# Configure Django's media and static file storage to use Google Cloud Storage
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'
GS_BUCKET_NAME = 'love-city-neighborhoods'  # Use the provided bucket name
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In your views.py file add the following to have your admin upload files to the right place and your API calls
    display them.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
# views.py
from google.cloud import storage


# Define the upload_file function for file uploads to Google Cloud Storage
def upload_file(file_path, bucket_name):
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(file_path)
    blob.upload_from_filename(file_path)

# Define the get_file_url function to get the public URL of a file in the bucket
def get_file_url(bucket_name, object_path):
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
    blob = bucket.blob(object_path)
    return blob.public_url
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    That's it! Easy as pie, really. I am happy to get that out of the way on the LOVE City Neighborhoods application.
