<h2>The History of Brandsite</h2>
<p>When the tech market got shaken up last year, all of the teams at my company were rearranged. I found myself working on an old company product called Brandsite. The challenges facing the project were two-fold.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Keeping up with creating, editing, and deploying all websites that use the Brandsite product.</li>
    <li>Cleaning up the technical debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose when Brandsite was created, the company didn't expect it to get so popular. The first developer didn't bother using a database. He kept the differing qualities of each website in a .env file in just one branch. When he wanted to change a website, he would comment in/out the values required, make edits, and deploy. Changes took a lot of time and required a lot of tedious developer intervention. We had non-technical staff to make these edits but no tool for them to use without touching code. We were obviously in need of a CMS that acted as a backend.</p>
<h2>The Brandsite Generator</h2>
<p>Brandsites were single-page websites that had similar attributes to one another like social media posts, coupons, text, images, etc. When edits came in, they had to touch four people before they were implemented, and another four before they were approved and finalized. It was a disaster. I am proud to have made the solution on my free time. It was my hackathon project and I finished it as my final project in my Intro to CS class with the Harvard Extension School. I implemented a solution that used the Django Admin to add data to a database for our frontend to call using an API that I built for it. The solution worked beautifully. It is in production and supporting a few dozen websites.</p>
<p>With the success came more responsibility. I was asked to add more features, like chatbots, age gates, loyalty rewards programs, and more. Different features required more and more customization. It has been challenging to keep it organized and user-friendly while accommodating more features. This week, I was asked for a feature that would change the whole thing.</p>
<h2>Adding Pages</h2>
<p>I used to be a backend-only developer. React is new to me, and it's the technology our frontend runs on. I took a boot camp in React, so I have some familiarity, but it wasn't strong or put to the test until this project. Passing props wasn't something I was incredibly interested in if I didn't have to do it. My colleague implemented a solution that wouldn't require us to feed the data from the backend call through all of the components of the entire site. Every component would have access to the same data structure through a hook called useContext. From there, it would just pull out the data it wanted. Props were successfully avoided, for the most part.</p>
<p>When I was asked to create the ability for an admin to make multiple pages and have them link within one another, this plan fell apart. I had to undo the work that we did with useContext and finally pull the props through the entire site. I touched 47 files and finally got it done. I also successfully implemented the feature. A site can now make multiple pages and link to them with navigation, in the footer, or elsewhere. It is pretty sweet. Brandsites are no longer single-page applications. This is now like a fully baked WordPress for coupon sites.</p>
<p>This week was an exhausting week. Lesson learned, do it right the first time. This corner that we initially cut made me have to do a significant amount of backtracking in the end.</p>
<h2>The Future of Brandsite Generator</h2>
<p>Next, I have to implement A/B testing for Brandsites. I have some ideas for how to make it happen. I also have to make sure that analytics are set up effectively to track a comparison. I don't have too much experience with Google Analytics. It should be interesting.</p>
