<p>One thing to know about me is I constantly have new ideas for improvement. I like to improve processes, products,
    code, my community, myself, whatever I can. I really like moving forward. I have a few goals that led me down a
    new side quest.</p>

<p>They are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Help make Philly a tech city</strong></li>
    <p>I love Philadelphia and I know that it has a lot of potential and bright future. In all of the uncertainty in
        predicting the events of the world, one thing has been clear for my whole life. We live in an age where
        technology is constantly moving forward. I'd like to be a part of bringing Philadelphia's future to fruition
        by helping to make it a destination for technology companies to set up shop and recruit talent.</p>

    <li><strong>Bring opportunity to Philly's youth</strong></li>
    <p>A great barrier to Philly's path forward is the social issues it faces. <a
            href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1901?g=160XX00US4260000&tid=ACSST5Y2022.S1901"
            target="_blank">Average household income</a> in Philly is under $80K with the bottom 25% earning less
        than $30K/year per family! I can't imagine. These kids don't have role models or opportunities because of
        the challenges their families face at home. Living here, it's obvious.</p>

    <li>Build my resume</li>
    <p>I am trying to get into graduate school and I need to beef up my resume. I have a decent amount of experience
        working with kids and I work with code professionally. I set out to find a program where I could do both,
        and I found one. I found a program called <a href="https://coderdojo.com/en" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>.
        It teaches kids to code by making games in C# with a platform called Unity. I started volunteering in it a
        few weeks ago.</p>
</ol>

<p>It can be tough because the kids have varying levels of motivation, interest, and hardware capabilities. It seems
    like some of their parents may be forcing them to do it. Some of their parents don't show up on time for their
    online lessons. Some of them do not have computers that are powerful enough to run Unity. I could also see it
    being frustrating being a kid that's really good at it and needing to wait for the other 10 kids in class to
    figure out how to install an IDE. I remember when I was in 5th grade I had a computer teacher called Mr. Byrd. I
    told him I knew how to write HTML. He gave me a quick quiz on the subject and then when I passed it he gave me
    my own curriculum to follow. Unfortunately, these kids won't have the resources I grew up with, but I'll do my
    best!</p>

<p>In any case, I am enjoying myself. I have never worked in C# before, but it is a lot like all of the other Object
    Oriented Programming languages. Unity is cool! I can see how some really advanced games are created with it. It
    also integrates very interestingly with code.</p>

<p>The lessons are structured around the tutorials provided by <a
        href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/explore-a-3d-world/0" target="_blank">RaspberryPi</a>.
    They walk through how to create a new project and make a character move around the screen. I also uploaded my
    new code to a new <a href="https://github.com/benmath247/learning-unity" target="_blank">Github repository</a>
    to mark the start of my journey in C#!</p>
