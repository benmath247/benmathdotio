<p>I am delighted to share that after a long career of waiting, procrastinating, ironing out the kinks, and learning,
    I finally deployed this personal site as my own. For all of the complaints AWS gives about being too complicated,
    they sure made it easy.
    I was struggling through permissions with Cloudfront Distributions, S3 Buckets, and the like. I work with these a
    lot at work but there are a lot of different hands in configuring them, it is hard to replicate independently on my
    own AWS acccount.
    I asked ChatGPT for a solution. Enter AWS Amplify.</p>
<p>It was literally as easy as 1, 2, 3.
    I connect the repository, confirm the build commands, and click deploy. When I push to master now, a new build is
    made from the master branch and the site is updated. Just like that! I am excited to finally have a site online.
    Now I need to optimize it for mobile, or maybe I won't!

    This was really as easy as can be. I only use a front end site, but the service seems to indicate it can handle back
    end stuff too. If it's just as easy, it's going to save me a lot of time in the future and really help bring my
    projects to the next level.

    Well, I'm off to a celebratory bed time. Good night!
