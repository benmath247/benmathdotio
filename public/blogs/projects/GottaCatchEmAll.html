A wise man once said, "Gotta Catch 'Em All". 
For Nintendo, it was a great selling point for why children should get more Pokemon cards. 
Now that I am an employed adult who likes to collect Pokemon cards, that sounds like a pretty daunting task.
First of all, in order to catch 'em all I would need to catch those Pokemon cards which already have owners.
Also, now that there are different print series, additions, gradings, etc. catching 'em all is a task that no longer is limited to the first 151 Pokemon cards.
Alas, I have resolves to only catch some of them. At best, one of each.

<h2>Gotta Catch Some of Them</h2>
<p>When it came to making my <a href="pokedex">Pokedex</a> application, catching 'em all meant all of the features that <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a> has to offer developers.
The game Pokemon is incredibly complex. It has multiple languages, Pokemon have different abilities, weaknesses, qualities, even temperments.
The idea of a Pokedex is to capture these qualities and statistics in one central place for users to access.
From a developers perspective, that means creating a front end to consume the PokeAPI.

<h2>Animation, kinda</h2>
<p>
    I did some pretty cool things with this project that I am proud of. First, I designed my own classes that I intend to use in other applications that allow elements on the page to grow in size on mouse hover.
    On the list page, I have the cards growing a little bit, but the Pokemon pngs inside of them growing by a greater degree so it looks like they are popping out of the page. It is pretty cool.
    On the same list page, I also pulled artwork from the API and made some time related logic to alternate between the normal picture, the shining picture, and the picture of the back.
    It looks like the Pokemon is shining then turning around then shining again on repeat, on mouse hover.
</p>
<h2>Pokemon Types</h2>
<p>
    One of the intricacies of Pokemon is the way different types of Pokemon effect each other.
    When a Pokemon type is selected, users can view the way it relates to other Pokemon types. They can also click on those other types to see their associated Pokemon and similar statistics.
</p>
<h2>Dynamic Colors</h2>
<p>
    I thought it would be pretty boring to look at a red screen the entire time. Pokemon and Pokemon types are both associated with specific colors, as per the API.
    The different elements on the page change color depending on what is selected. To take this a step further, I wrote a function to take in a hexidecimal value and darken it according to a certain input value.
    So, not only are there customized colors from the Pokemon API, but I also have darker or brighter colors throughout the site that change depending on what is selected.
</p>
<h2>Outstanding Features</h2>
<p>They say that art is never finished, only abandoned. I guess that is the idea behind catching 'em all. You never can. You can either stop or keep going.
    I would venture to say that nobody has ever caught 'em all. Similarly, I didn't build out all of the features I could from the PokeAPI. I would like to move on. Some features I will knock out eventually are including an abilities stats display and list filter dropdown. I would also like to redesign the details page, because it looks like a lot of Bootstrap.
</p>
<p>Designing this app was on my programming bucket list for a long time. I am glad that it is complete to some degree.</p>
