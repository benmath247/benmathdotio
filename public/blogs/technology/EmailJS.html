    EmailJS is a platform that allows you to send emails from your app, enabling contact forms.
    I have been wrestling with different providers of this service, such as AWS SES, Mailchimp, and Sendgrid.
    Each, for one reason or another, didn't work out quickly, resulting in nonfunctional contact forms on my sites.
    No longer! I have found the solution.
</p>
<p>
    EmailJS is exactly as easy to use as I think it should be. You make an account on
    <a href="https://www.emailjs.com">EmailJS.com</a>. Next, you connect your mailbox.
    If you're signed in on your Chrome browser, it's as easy as clicking "Sign Up with Google."
    This is called a service. Make note of the Service ID and store it in an environment variable.
</p>
<p>
    You then create a template with custom fields, such as name, to_email_address, and message.
    Make note of the Template ID and save it as an environment variable in your .env file.
    These fields will be filled in with the contact form and later submitted in a dictionary as part of a request to
    EmailJS.
    Lastly, you need to go to the account page and get your User ID. Save that as an environment variable too.
</p>
<p>
    So, assume that we have a form that provides values for email, message, and name, and passes them as a dictionary
    that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
        const templateParams = {
            "email": email,
            "message": message,
            "name": name
        };
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    Implementing the code looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    // include this onClick on the form
    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        emailjs.send(
            //here are my .env variables
            import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID,
            import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID,
            templateParams,
            import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID
        ).then((result) => {
            console.log("SUCCESS")
        }, (error) => {
            console.log(error)
        });
    };
</code>
Your .env file should have something like this in it with the values you got from EmailJS.
<code>
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID='service_abcdeo'
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID='template_fghij'
VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID='KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
</code>
    </pre>
<p>
    It's as easy as that. Click the button to the form and you will get an email! I really liked this tech because it is
    free and easy to set up.
    I couldn't believe how quickly I got it done, and without having a backend of my own responsible for sending the
    emails.
