    I remember it like it was yesterday. Months earlier, I had landed a cushy job at Lincoln Financial. Every morning, I
    got dressed in business casual attire and went into an office in Commerce Square on the 34th floor. It was a heck of
    a view. But on that fateful day, I was allowed to work from home for the first time.
</p>
<p>
    I had a doctor's appointment in the late morning, so I woke up and checked my email from my phone to make sure I
    wasn't needed. I took a slow morning to enjoy this new plateau of privilege before heading out to my doctor's
    appointment.
</p>
<p>
    When I arrived back after the doctor's appointment, I opened my laptop to furious messages from my boss
    complaining that I hadn't been online for 14 hours. Someone else in the company complained that they couldn't get a
    hold of me for the two hours that I was away and told my boss. The timeline made sense to me because there were 8
    hours between work days, I hadn't opened my laptop in the morning, and I had a doctor's appointment.
</p>
<p>
    I really didn't want to make my boss angry about this, so I ran as fast as I could to the office to show that I was
    there and I wasn't sleeping on the job.
</p>
<p>
    What a different time it was. I often wondered why we had the office at all. What a waste of money. We occupied
    three floors in some of the most expensive commercial real estate in Philadelphia. Some of the rooms weren't even
    used. I worked exclusively on my computer every day. The real reason that nobody wanted to say was that our company
    hadn't yet taken the steps needed to ensure proper communication, setting of expectations, and accountability in an
    all-digital workplace.
</p>
<p>
    All of that changed in March of 2020 when every office in the country was forced to make the jump, whether they
    liked it or not. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a trend that was already gaining momentum: the rise of remote
    work. As businesses worldwide adapted to the challenges posed by the pandemic, many employees discovered the
    benefits of remote work arrangements, including increased flexibility, improved work-life balance, and accelerated
    technological improvement (we hope). To the digital-first segment of the workforce, this was a long time coming. I
    told you we needed this.
