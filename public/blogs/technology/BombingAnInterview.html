<p>
    This morning was rough.
    It was one of those interviews where you could tell how it is about to go from the very beginning.
    <!-- I signed on and the interviewer looked very unfriendly, almost angry, to be interviewing me. -->
    I'll admit, technical interviews are not my strength. Also, I hate doing them. I have declined jobs that were
    otherwise a great cultural fit because they asked me to do meaningless code exercises only to be thrown out later.
    I thought that since there would be a company representative present on this one it was a fair use of my time and
    I'd give it a shot.
</p>
<p>
    The interviewer had me write some code in the Zoom chat, which I didn't like to do. It messed with capitalization,
    etc and was pretty unpleasant.
    The questions were oddly phrased and paired with a thick accent that made things more difficult for my
    understanding.
    For example, he asked if I knew anything about Lambda. I talked for two minutes about AWS Lambda. He was talking
    about the Lambda functions.
    Whatever. Some of the questions were fair and some I answered well. Regardless, I don't think it was the job for me.
</p>
<p>
    I want to turn this into a learning experience and use this blog post to reflect on what I learned and how I could
    better answer the questions.
</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What is a dictionary</li>
    <p>
        Simple enough. I use dictionaries every day.
        It is a list of key value pairs.
        Keys are a string, tuple, or a number that point to a value.
        I got this wrong because I said they couldn't be numbers when he asked me.
        I have never worked with keys as numbers.
        Keys are unique and immutable.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs in a dictionary, making it a versatile data structure for various
        tasks like data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in Python.
    </p>
    <li>What is the ORM used for?</li>
    <p>
        Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is used to map objects in your code to tables in a relational database. It
        provides an abstraction layer that allows you to interact with the database using objects and classes instead of
        writing raw SQL queries. This simplifies database operations and makes it easier to work with databases in your
        software applications.
    </p>

    <li>What is a lambda?</li>
    <p>
        In Python, a lambda function is an anonymous, small, and inline function that can have any number of arguments
        but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where you
        don't want to define a full function using the `def` keyword. They are often used as arguments to higher-order
        functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.
    </p>

    <li>What are decorators used for?</li>
    <p>
        Decorators in Python are used to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods. They are typically
        applied to functions using the "@" symbol and are commonly used for tasks like logging, authorization, caching,
        and more. Decorators allow you to add functionality to functions without modifying their code directly,
        promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.
    </p>

    <li>Why would you use a list versus a tuple?</li>
    <p>
        Lists and tuples in Python are both used to store collections of items, but there are key differences between
        them. Lists are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements after creation. Tuples, on the other
        hand, are immutable, and their elements cannot be changed once they are defined. You would use a list when you
        need a collection of items that may change during the program's execution. Tuples are useful when you want to
        create a collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates or configuration settings.
    </p>

    <li>Why are tuples immutable?</li>
    <p>
        Tuples are immutable in Python to ensure their integrity and make them suitable for use as keys in dictionaries
        or elements in sets. Immutability guarantees that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be accidentally
        or maliciously modified, making it safe for certain use cases where data should remain constant. This
        immutability also allows tuples to be hashable, which is necessary for dictionary keys and set elements.
    </p>

    <li>How can you efficiently use Python to count the number of times a value appears in a list?</li>
    <p>
        You can efficiently count the number of times a value appears in a list using the `count()` method provided by
        Python lists. Here's an example:
    <pre>
        <code>
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2]
value_to_count = 2

count = my_list.count(value_to_count)
print(f"The value {value_to_count} appears {count} times in the list.")
        </code>
    </pre>
    This code snippet will count the occurrences of value_to_count in my_list and print the result.
    </p>
</ol>
<p>
    Well, that was fun. These questions really aren't very far out of the range of things that I know about. I'll do
    better next time.
    Ultimately, I am happy with where I am in life and every failed interview that has got me here. I look forward to
    getting the right job that is right for me, at the right time.
</p>
<p>*Update: I got a second round interview! That's weird.</p>
<!-- <p>
    **Update 2: I got the job offer! Which was weird because I really think the technical interview went poorly.
    It comes with a story though.
</p>
<p>
    When we got into the salary negotiation the recruiter ghosted me for four days then informed me via text that they
    had to withdraw their offer.
    It was especially devistating because my current employer just finished telling me that even though I met our agreed
    upon milestones, they wouldn't be giving me the raise they had committed to.
    I was not happy. I have never felt so kicked when I was down before.
</p>
<p>
    After some reflection, I am rewinding a few weeks to when my company had layoffs and I was spared. For that, I am
    grateful. I have a feeling there was a fight to keep me too. I don't take that for granted.
    However, I am feeling a bit stuck in my career and without a path forward.
    I am remembering <a href="/blog/A%20Personal%20Anecdote%20on%20Failure">my recent blog post about failure</a> and
    looking forward to the future good that will come from this unfortunate circumstance.
</p>
<p>
    I also have been thinking that it is on me for not making myself so competitive in the workforce that jobs are
    popping out at me.
    There is a lot I can do to further my career even if I have hit a brick wall at work.
    In the words of Rocky, "It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving
    forward."
</p>
<p>
    Here's to moving forward!
