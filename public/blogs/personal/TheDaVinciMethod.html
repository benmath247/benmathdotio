<h3>The DaVinci Method</h3>
<p>
    This post is dedicated to my sister, and I'll explain why later. My career hasn't been a straight line.
    What started out as promoting student-run parties in university morphed into promoting stadium-scale events for Live Nation. This, in turn, evolved into running advertising campaigns for 1-MCP, a chemical used to treat a third of the world's apples. Eventually, it led to a job at Lincoln Financial.
    That's where what I call the DaVinci Method took effect.

<h5>Why is it called the DaVinci Method?</h5>
<p>
    DaVinci was arguably the most famous of the Renaissance men. These were men who could do it all. 
    They were artists, scientists, philosophers, you name it.
    DaVinci's and other Renaissance men's skills often complemented each other even though they seemed unrelated.

<h5>The DaVinci Method in Practice</h5>

    A blessing and a curse in my family is we are never quite satisfied where we are. 
    My two siblings and I all share this trait and are all working on being content with where and who we are. 
    That seems kind of ironic to me, but I digress.
    I have always shot for the moon and done my best to land among the stars.
    While I worked for the agency that put me with the chemical client, I studied financial analysis.
    I did a self-led course provided by Bloomberg on all things financial analysis in preparation for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level 1 designation.
    I did not finish the course, but I learned a lot! I was about 23 and not sure what to do with my future. I felt like I was flailing.

    When money began to run out, I realized I had to do something to get a real job I could commit to full time.
    I applied all over the place, but the place that stuck was Lincoln Financial. I got a job as a Marketing Specialist. 
    The catalyst was the financial analysis designation that I didn't reach. I had no idea it would lead me to this role.
    There's the DaVinci Method in full effect.

    It's not a real thing. It's just something I came up with and use to group together actions that complement each other in the end.
    It's not the first time this has happened for me either. I learned coding in the first grade. 
    I was 5 and writing HTML1 to help build my school's website. 
    That benefited me in my promotion career in college because I was able to write scripts that would manipulate Facebook to do some truly excellent things with marketing automation.
    I used my marketing skills and combined my seemingly unrelated skill of writing code to invite thousands of people to like my clients' Facebook pages or attend their events. 
    Today at my job at Inmar, this intersection of skills has put me working on state-of-the-art MarTech software.

    Now my sister took the cake today. She took a grant writing class in college. 
    After college, she moved to NYC to become a professional dancer and has since graduated to LA.
    She uses her grant writing skills as a way to earn extra income by helping artists discover and apply for grants.
    She used the DaVinci Method because she has always wanted to dance for big names like Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez.
    Today she noticed that Beyonce's choreographer has a nonprofit that could benefit from her grant writing services.
    She reached out, and now has a meeting. Go Shira! That's huge. 
    Who would have thought that these two skills would have a chance to intersect so perfectly at a point far in the future of her career and allow her to open a door that otherwise stays shut.

    The takeaway from this is that no matter where my interests may take me, it's important to remember that not all who wander are lost.
    Sometimes we just need to find a different way to our target destination. Sometimes it turns out to be a better way. Sometimes our wandering leads to innovation and opportunity that has not been seen before.
