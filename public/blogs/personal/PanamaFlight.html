    If you've read a couple of my recent blog posts you probably know I have been on the road for a while. It is mid-January and I left NYC at the end of August.
    From NYC I set off on a road trip across the United States in an effort to complete my tour of every mainland state. My 48th state was Idaho, and it was glorious.
    After that I to Philly for a few weeks before embarking on an equally memorable journey. I went to Florida to visit my girlfriend's family. T
    hen we went to Colombia and then Argentina to meet more of her family.

    To be honest, I wasn't such a fan of my experience in Colombia. I found the disparity of wealth disturbing.
    I also felt like a target as a non-Spanish speaking traveler from the United States. We met some great people, had some good times, ate great food, and then we were on our way to Buenos Aires, Argentina.
    I must say, Colombian cuisine is some of my favorite in the world so far.

    In Argentina we were greeted by my girlfriend's wonderful family. We spent a few weeks hanging around Buenos Aires working and hanging out with the family on the nights and weekends.
    Buenos Aires was a lot like Tel Aviv, France, Florence, and a lot of other Western style cities. 
    It was pretty different from the other cities I have visited in South America like Lima, Cuzco, and Medellin.
    It was an interesting time to be there because they just got a new president who was making a lot of change.
    In my limited view, they really needed it. Argentina was in crisis. They measure double digit inflation by the month and the corruption in their government was at an all time high.

    At the end of it, we went somewhere that I never thought I'd be, Uruguay. 
    It was beautiful! It was especially eye opening because I am sure that if you asked me what I thought Uruguay was like before I went I would have told you its a whole bunch of coffee farms and undeveloped land.
    They had that. But they also had some of the most beautiful and well developed beach towns I have ever seen, complete with high prices and a thirving tourism industry.
    It definitely makes me wonder to what degree my other preconceived notions about the world are true or false.

    Unfortunately, on my last day in Uruguay I learned that my grandmother died.
    She had dementia and for a few months now I have been worried every time I pick up the phone about whether or not it's the call when they tell me she's gone.
    She died peacefully and quickly in her home. We all loved her very much and she will be sorely missed.
    It's worth saying that my grandmother survived the Holocaust and came to America with nothing, not even nourishment.
    She is my case and point for why anyone can make it in this country if they don't make excuses for themselves. 
    She did not speak English when she arrived but she finished high school in just two years because she had to work to support her sick father.
    She worked hard until she was eighty-three and could not work any more. Her home was modest but the most love filled and comfortable place I have ever been.
    She found a loving husband and had a family. She put two generations of us through college including me, my brother, and sister.
    My Bubby was the strongest woman I'll ever meet, and I met Dianne Nyad, who was the first person to swim from Cuba to Miami.

    I am on a flight back to USA now. 
    I was going to do this flight at this time anyway but now there's a funeral on the other side of it. Not fun.
    I was really looking forward to being back in Philly. 
    One of the things I was looking forward to the most was waking up in the morning and driving to a coffee shop near her home and visiting on my lunch break.
    She will be burried in good company, next to my grandfather and all of her sisters. My good friend Dave's grandfather is even a couple of feet away too! Small world.
</p>

    Nevertheless, it will be nice to be home and surround myself with friends and family. This is my last flight, and then I only have two trains and an Uber before I arrive.
