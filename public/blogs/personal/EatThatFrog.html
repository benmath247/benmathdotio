    I decided that I am going to start 75 Hard. 
    That is a lifestyle challenge where participants drink a gallon of water a day, exercise for 2 hours a day (1 hour outdoors), follow a diet, do not drink alcohol, and read 10 pages a day.
    I am, admittedly, off to a slow start. I was going to start when I got back from my travels but I got sick and both my grandmother and my car battery died. 
    There is always something that gets in the way, but these obstacles are pretty big and I just need about a week to get around them.

    I had a list of books picked out for the reading challenge, but with my dead car battery I could not get to my storage unit.
    I decided to find a free book online and get started anyway. The book that I am reading is <a target='_blank' href="https://www.al-edu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Eat_That_Frog.pdf">Eat That Frog</a>.
    I am on day 2 of reading it. Here are my notes so far.
