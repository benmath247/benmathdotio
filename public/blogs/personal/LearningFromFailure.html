    Right before the pandemic began I quit my job and ended my lease to go travel the world.
    I was planning to go to Spain, Portugal, Poland, Israel, Greece, and Thailand on a one way ticket.
    My flight was scheduled for 3/16/2020 or something like that.
    You never know when some freakish global catastrophe is going to completely uproot your plans.
    It's important to be able to adapt.
</p>
<p>
    When the pandemic caused airports to close across the globe I found myself stuck.
    I was staying with a friend, without a job, without a home, without a clue of what I was going to do next.
    I bought an old bike for $50 so I could go back and forth from my friend's house to the city.
    On a particularly nice day, I decided to take some pictures of my bike.
    They were so good that I even decided to put the bike up for sale on Facebook and make some money.
</p>
<h2>Failure to Success #1</h2>
<p>
    The bike sold immediately for $165 with multiple people reaching out to buy it.
    Fantastic! I rode it to West Philly to the buyer and went to find a new bike to buy.
    I serendipitiously discovered the same exact model bike for sale less than a quarter mile away for around the same
    price as what I bought the first one for!
    What luck! I bought that bike and decided to sell it to one of the people who wanted to buy the last one.
    I had to ride it far into South Philly to make the sale, but I did it.
    By the time I sold the bike, it was late at night, I was exhausted, but I felt great.
    I just made around $200 in a day for the first time in a while, and a new venture was born.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't realize at the time that I had just uncovered a booming demand in the bike market for the pandemic.
    People needed fitness equipment and transportation because in the city they were afraid to ride public
    transportation or go to the gym.
    I went around buying and reselling bikes every day for a few weeks. I started with one and quickly moved to two,
    then three, then five.
    I was moving a few bikes a day and doing well for myself to make ends meet while I figured out what was next for me.
</p>
<h2>Failure to Success #2</h2>
<p>
    As I sold more bikes I thought about scaling my business more and more.
    I was about to learn a valuable lesson.
    I took a UHaul a few times around the suburbs to pick up great deals on bikes that I could resell.
    A lot of them were sold at great prices but had a few problems that I could fix easily.
    A lot of them just needed to be cleaned with soap and water.
    I began looking for someone to sell me a few dozen bikes instead of just one.
    I found a guy who said he would sell my 20 bikes for $1000. His name was Dan.
    Dan said they were all in reasonable shape but just needed a tune up. Dan was a liar.
    I showed up to buy the bikes and I threw them in my Uhaul without taking a good look.
    I noticed they were in rough shape but I didn't realize how bad. They were pretty useless, way beyond what I could
    fix.
</p>
<p>
    When I began to unload, I had no idea what I'd do next. I had just dropped so much of my profit on new bikes that I
    couldn't resell or fix.
    Without knowing what to do next, I did what was working for me. I bought a new bike from someone and sold it.
    A few bikes later someone I was buying from had dozens and dozens of old bikes. I explained to him my situation and
    asked him if he could fix my bikes for me.
    He said no problem. I asked him if he could sell me more bikes too. He sold me another 20 at $50 each. His name was
    Don.
</p>
<p>
    Don solved my problems. I was out of hot water with my broken inventory and I wouldn't need to go find bikes for a
    while.
    Don also allowed me to buy broken bikes and have somewhere that could fix them.
    We developed something great. I dropped them off, he fixed them and had his guys bring them to me. I sold them.
</p>
<p>
    I had been selling these bikes out of a creepy basement in Center City Philadelphia where my girlfriend lived.
    It was time to scale up. The best part of Philadelphia is the community here. I put out some feelers in the Italian
    Market and someone told me of an older woman with a garage forr rent.
    I boldly knocked on the door and asked if I could rent the garage without any further introduction. Remarkably, she
    said yes!
    The space was beautifully located around the corner from a ragtag bike repair shop that was willing to repair even
    more bikes for me.
</p>
<h2>A Happy Ending</h2>
<p>
    After doing an 80/20 analysis, I realized that 80% of my profit came from selling, which I spend 20% of the time on.
    I began to hire people to get the bikes for me and I adopted a new model. Whatever bike they brought me, I'd pay
    them $100-120 for if it was in working condition.
    I even hired someone on Upwork to do my marketing for me. The process was simple. I maintained an Instagram where I
    put pictures of all of the bikes that I was selling.
    When the drivers would bring me new ones, I'd pay them and put up new pictures of bikes.
    My marketer would keep an eye on the Instagram and whenever there were new listings, she'd put ads up on Craigslist,
    Facebook, and other used product platforms.
    If people had questions about the bikes, she'd tell them to just come in to my location and give them the address.
    She'd even put up listings with a bunch of different bikes just to get attention and tell people what we were doing.
</p>
<p>
    It was wonderful. My job became to sit in the garage and sell bikes all Spring and Summer. The weather was
    beautiful.
    I remember going down the street to the Italian Market to get lunch often. I'd enjoy the $1 coffee at Geno's Steaks.
    It worked out for me, selling over 300 bikes, until it was the end of the season and I decided to close down the
    shop and move on.
</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
    Nobody ever wants to intentionally make a mistake.
    This often creates a fear of making mistakes and keeps people confined to their status quos.
    My biggest mistakes in making my pandemic bike business helped me to grow substantially every single time.
    If I had never made a mistake, I would never have taken the next step.
    It's important to be calculated but also bold. Even when you make mistakes and have to suffer the consequences, you
    never know where you'll wind up after you fix them.
