<h3>First, some background</h3>
<p>
    When I was a student at Temple University, I threw parties of the craziest sort. Yes, we've all partied in college,
    but I can confidently say, my experience is in the top 1%. As a sophomore I enjoyed living in the Zeta Beta Tau
    house and throwing my own private parties with the brothers, infrastructure and living space. As a junior and
    through the rest of my tenure at the university, I created and managed a social media presence that grew to be the
    top influencer at school. The draw was that I told everyone where there were parties every weekend. This shtick
    earned me 30K+ subscribers and more than 500K monthly views across Twitter (RIP), Facebook, Snapchat, and IG. I even
    had sponsorship and promotion agreements with the likes of Live Nation, Red Bull, Vita Coco, and other college
    facing clients. After some time advertising through my platform was the only way to successfully have a well
    attended party for most groups.
</p>
<p>
    You see, at Temple, parties were a business. While I went to bed early, attendees stayed out late to be charged $5
    per person and came 400+ at a time to some ill conceived basement haunt in North Philly.
    There were between two and six parties per night on the weekends, usually. The DJ got paid about $100. Security got
    paid $50 an hour, if they were needed. I got paid $50 per party for my advertising services. It was the easiest
    money I've ever made. The fun and impact of my project was in incredibly memorable and validating experience.
</p>
<h3>Realization of The Drywall Effect</h3>
<p>
    One surprising constant at events I promoted was the patterns in the patrons' behavior regarding the way they
    treated their host's drywall. A house that had not been partied in would usually come out unscathed. Unfortunately,
    once in a while, some fool would punch a hole in the drywall for reasons that are still beyond my comprehension. If
    such a thing transpired and the host opted to have another party without repairing the holes there would inevitably
    be more holes the very next time. The effect was the same with grafitti.
</p>
<p>
    I never took a statistical sample, but I would estimate that the chance of a host getting a hole punched in their
    wall was normally about 5% but it would go up to 50% or more if there already was a hole. Now that I am in more
    advanced stages of my life, I see a very similar pattern in the way people treat their cities, bodies, goals, and
    habits.
</p>
<h3>The Drywall Effect in the Neighborhood</h3>
<p>
    On a more positive note, I believe that the Drywall Effect works for positive change as well.
    In my first week of living with my newly Philadelphia emigrated girlfriend, Jennifer, Philly got a ton of snow. It
    was pretty comical because we had just come from 100 degree weather in Argentina and usually it never snows in
    Philly. Nevertheless, it was snowing. On the first storm I just let the snow sit. For the second storm, I activated
    the Drywall Effect.
</p>
<p>
    In my hometown in New Jersey everyone had lots of sidewalk and driveways to shovel. Shoveling snow would take hours
    and was a very labor intensive task. Here in Philly it takes a minute to shovel your fifteen feet of sidewalk. I
    grabbed a shovel and happily got to shoveling my sidewalk and then my neighbors on each side. Sure enough, a few
    moments later I had neighbors come out from different parts of the street and all do the same thing. Before long,
    the whole block was shoveled by just a handful of friendly neighbors on both sides of the street.
</p>
<h3>Fitness and the Drywall Effect</h3>
<p>
    Everyone's fitness journey is different, as is their relationship with food and exercise. For me, this is an
    especially important place where my good or bad habits pick up momentum and shape me into who I am. When I wake up
    early in the morning and go exercise, it gives me a reason to eat healthy food, go to sleep early, drink water, and
    otherwise treat my body with care. I am working on building something that I care about. These behaviors keep away
    the bad habits because I am focused and happy with the progress I am making, usually.
</p>
<p>
    Conversely, sometimes a bad habit will initiate a series of cascading poor decisions that take some time to recover
    from. For example, I don't drink enough water so I am very hungry at the end of the day, so I eat some junk food, so
    I don't feel well enough to work out, so I eat more junk food, so my stomach hurts, so I stay up late, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
    I think a lot about my health and fitness, so I have noticed that I am either on the upswing or the downswing. It
    never quite feels like moderation.
</p>
<h3>Drywall Effect in Society</h3>
<p>
    I care deepy about Philadelphia, but what I am about to describe extends to a lot of big cities and their problems.
    I won't write about it, but I can think of many instances of the social issues found in West Coast cities
    sharing similar patterns. Philadelphia is sometimes nicknamed Filthadelphia by those who are not fans of the city's
    level of commitment to hygiene. Someone dumps a bag of trash on the side of the road in a forgotten neighborhood
    near I95 and then suddenly the road becomes a home for litter, vagrancy, drug use, and all kinds of issues. I love
    Philly because I believe that regular people can make a huge difference here.
</p>
<p>
    In 2018 lived across the street from such an abandoned lot. It was disgusting. I would look out of my kitchen window
    and see a mountain of trash. Gross! It looked like it had been accumulating there for years. One day I decided that
    I've had enough and I bought some contractor bags and gloves. I got up early to get to work on the weekends. It
    wasn't easy, but I slowly chipped away at the mess in this lot over the course of a few weekends.
</p>
<p>
    <small>Funny Anecdote: Once while I was doing this, my high school prom date walked by. I hadn't seen her in
        years. She looked good but I was up to my knees in garbage. Explaining to her what I was doing was funny. I
        swear I'm not usually playing in garbage.</small>
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, by the end of it the lot was perfectly clean. Now, six years later, I am delighted to share that it is still
    clean. I don't have all of the time in the world to do this myself around the rest of Philadelphia, but I truly
    believe we can turn our city's reputation around if we clean up. Doing a good job once will make future clean ups
    much lower effort and more effective for years to come. The same can be said for solving many of the city's social
    issues. I hope one day I am in a position to do more to that end.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    So that's the Drywall Effect in action. You do stuff, good or bad, and it creates momentum in its impact. If you
    ignore the impact, it will continue and snowball. If you take effective action to correct it, you can build great
    momentum, motivation, and involvement from your community. Problems left unsolved will beget more problems that are
    similar. Keeping things nice and clean and taking care of problems quickly as they arise will create an environment
    for stability, progress, and high performance.
