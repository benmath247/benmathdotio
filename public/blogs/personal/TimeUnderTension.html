    My friend Steve is strong, but that's an understatement. Steve has the strength of all of my other friends put
    together and has taught me a valuable leson; but first, an anecdote. I was fortunate to live with Steve in college.
    When one of the roommates locked himself out of his room, Steve accidentally tore the door frame down, hinges, door
    post, and all and effectively fixed the problem. He was freakishly strong and muscular, amassing thousands of
    followers on his fitness accounts on social media. Steve has since shifted his focus from bodybuilding but remains
    the strongest person I know both physically and mentally. Despite his smaller-than-college size, he can still fling
    me across the room with just a flick of his wrist.

    People always ask him how he gets so strong but as a close friend I have been able to drill down on the nuance of
    his answers. He no longer bench presses 400 pounds and straps multiple steel plates to himself before his pullups.
    Instead, the focus has shifted to <em>time under tension</em> and quality of repetition in simple weight training
    exercises.

    Time under tension refers to the duration that muscles are under strain during an exercise set, emphasizing the
    importance of the tempo in both the lifting and lowering phases to maximize muscle growth and strength gains.
    Yesterday I went to the gym and did a few sets of four seconds of time under tension per repetition. It was lower
    weight but the feeling was insane!

    Time under tension in learning can be likened to the focused, consistent effort and practice one dedicates to
    mastering a skill or concept. Just as muscles grow under sustained tension, cognitive abilities and knowledge deepen
    with prolonged, deliberate engagement and repetition.

    Lately I have been learning about data structures and algorithms with a course at UC Berkeley Extension. In my
    studies, time under tension translates to the focused and continuous effort I put
    into solving complex problems and understanding intricate algorithms like the Blossom Algorithm in my final project.
    As I dive deeper into advanced topics, the sustained mental engagement helps solidify my grasp of tough topics like
    this, much like our muscles strengthen under prolonged exertion. The more time I spend wrestling with these
    challenging concepts and problems, the more adept I become at applying them effectively in different scenarios, and
    with greater ease.

    Update: I feel like I really didn't learn very much in this course, but I got an A! Hooray!
